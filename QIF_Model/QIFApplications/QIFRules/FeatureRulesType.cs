    \brief Defines two methods of setting the quantity of hit points

          The FeatureRulesType defines two methods of setting the quantity
        of hit points to use for a feature and/or a strategy to use for
        selecting the hit points and/or the substitute feature algorithm to
        use to fit the feature to the hit points. If the
        IfThenElseFeatureRules and MaxFeatureRules are both used to find
        the quantity of points for a feature, both sets of rules should be
        applied and the maximum value should be used. Also if both are used
        and they give different point sampling strategies or different
        substitute feature algorithms, the evaluating system may use any of
        those strategies or algorithms.

          Since a given feature F may be associated with zero to many
        characteristics C1 ... Cn, if there is any characteristic
        associated with F, the rules should be evaluated for each FCi pair,
        and the number or density of hit points to use for F should be set
        to the maximum value.

          If a number of hit points must be compared with a density of hit
        points, the evaluating system should find and use the area of the
        feature to convert density values to numbers of points.

          So that a single rules file may be used in different situations,
        the rules include a SamplingCategoryIs Boolean expression that
        tests whether the sampling category is equal to a particular value.
        If a set of rules includes one or more rules containing a
        SamplingCategoryIs test, the rules are to be evaluated in an
        environment in which the sampling category has been set to some
        positive integer. The meaning of a sampling category is determined
        by whoever writes the rules. For example, 1 might mean first
        article inspection while 5 means process control. As another
        example, Sampling categories 1 through 3 might represent LOW,
        MEDIUM, and HIGH, respectively. An alternative to using rules
        containing SamplingCategoryIs tests is to write a separate rules
        file for each category.

          Numerical quantities that are constants, feature parameters, or
        characteristic parameters may be used in conditions.

          The numerical quantities FeatureLength and FeatureArea may also
        be used in conditions. The evaluating system must set the value of
        FeatureLength for the feature being processed if FeatureLength is
        used in any condition. The evaluating system must set the value of
        FeatureArea for the feature being processed if FeatureArea is used
        in any condition.

          The rules are not intended for picking the quantity of points or
        point sampling strategy to use for measuring a characteristic that
        is not associated with any feature.
